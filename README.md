# üßä GRA/GRO Performance in Frozen Sectors ‚ùÑÔ∏è  
**A creative Power BI portfolio project simulating Veeva Vault RIM regulatory workflows**

---

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of my preparation for the **Senior Decision Science Analyst** position at **Sanofi**, supporting **Global Regulatory Affairs (GRA)** and **Global Regulatory Operations (GRO)**.

The goal was to demonstrate:
- My technical proficiency in **Power BI**, **DAX**, **R**, and **Deneb**
- My understanding of **regulatory data workflows** (e.g., submissions, approvals, health authority interactions)
- My ability to communicate insights through **creative and engaging storytelling**

---

## üß† Project Highlights

- **AI-generated datasets** simulate real-world Veeva Vault RIM data:
  - `vault_rim_data.csv`: submission records with KPIs such as cycle time, query flags, and planned vs actual dates
  - `gantt_data.csv`: GRA/GRO task tracking data for Gantt chart visuals

- **Power BI dashboard** includes:
  - KPI Cards with conditional formatting
  - Custom **Gantt chart** using [Deneb](https://deneb.io) (Vega-Lite JSON spec)
  - **Sankey diagram** built with embedded **R script** (`networkD3` package)
  - **IconMap visual** for interactive Antarctica-themed sector mapping
  - **Alert filters** to track short submission delays
  - Winter-themed **Figma-inspired layout** with custom fonts, color palette, and visuals

## KPIs Tracked

- Average Submission Cycle Time  
- Health Authority (HA) Query Rate  
- Approval Rate  
- On-Time Submission Rate  
- Data Completeness Score  
- (Bonus) Alert System for delayed actions

## üßä Theme & Storytelling

Set in an imaginary **Antarctic regulatory landscape**, the dashboard maps performance across "frozen sectors" (Still North, Other North, etc.) and products like **SnowX**, **IceA**, and **FrostB**.  
This creative frame helps engage stakeholders while presenting serious regulatory KPIs in a clear, accessible format.
